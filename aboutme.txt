My favorite technology is probably electric cars, specifically a small one with a big battery and good range even in winter, perfect for Wolt deliveries.
I’m also into premium audio systems (Bang & Olufsen, Burmeister or Harman & Kardon) with strong bass, but if I had to choose just one, I’d definitely go with EVs.
